## Email Template (Initial Outreach)
Subject: {{ company_name }} – Free PQC Crypto Posture Assessment

Hi {{ first_name }},

Post‑quantum standards are landing fast. We built CarnotEngine to map high‑risk, long‑lived cryptography (HNDL) across code, runtime traffic, and cloud key inventories—then quantify exposure (% of long‑secrecy assets still on legacy primitives).

We’re offering a complimentary assessment for a limited set of design partners:
- Unified CryptoBOM (static + runtime + cloud)
- HNDL exposure % and policy gaps (key size, hybrid readiness, tagged keys)
- Actionable 90‑day remediation roadmap

If interested, I can onboard your team with a lightweight script (<15 min, no prod impact) and return the one‑pager report (PDF) in 48h.

Open to a quick 15‑min call this week?

Best,

Hi {{ first_name }}, just bubbling this up—happy to reserve a slot for a complimentary crypto posture assessment (focus: long‑lived secret risk & PQC migration). Worth a look?

Thanks,
